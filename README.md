# React + Vite Project

This repository is a part of our larger project and focuses on using React in conjunction with Vite. It provides a minimal setup for React with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and incorporates some ESLint rules for code consistency.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Project-MedBay/frontend.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd [Your Project Directory Name]```
3. Install the required dependencies: ```npm install```
4. Start the development server: ```npm run dev```

This will launch the server and you can start working on your project with hot reload at localhost.

### Plugins Used

The project uses two official Vite plugins for React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This plugin employs [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
